-s::
--size=::
	Size in bytes of the volatile partition requested.

	Size must align to the devices partition_alignment_bytes.
	Use 'cxl list -m <memdev> -I' to find partition_alignment_bytes.

	Size must be less than or equal to the device's partitionable bytes.
	Calculate partitionable bytes by subracting the volatile_only_bytes,
	and the persistent_only_bytes, from the total_bytes.
	Use 'cxl list -m <memdev> -I' to find the above mentioned_byte values.

-v::
	Turn on verbose debug messages in the library (if libcxl was built with
	logging and debug enabled).
