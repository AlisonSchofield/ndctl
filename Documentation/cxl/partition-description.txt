DESCRIPTION
-----------
Partition the device into volatile and persistent capacity. The change
in partitioning will become the “next” configuration, to become active
on the next device reset.

Use "cxl list -m <memdev> -I" to examine the partitioning capabilities
of a device. A partition_alignment_bytes value of zero means there are
no partitionable bytes available and therefore the partitions cannot be
changed.

Using this command to change the size of the persistent capacity shall
result in the loss of data stored.
